# Celebrating hacktoberfest with source{d}

A repository for [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) 2018.

Let's start by saying who we are!

## Participants

Jeremy Antonio @thejeremyantonio

## Finding issues to fix

You can fix *any* of the issues under github.com/src-d or github.com/bblfsh,
but those marked with the label `#hacktoberfest` are probably the best to go for.

The issues labeled `#hacktoberfest` can be found here: http://bit.ly/hacktoberfest-sourced

## Rules

If you get 3 PRs merged in a source{d} repo you'll get a t-shirt from source{d}.

If you get 5 PRs merged labeld as `#hacktoberfest` in *any* repo you'll get a hacktoberfest t-shirt.

If you solve 200 PRs ... you still get one t-shirt.

## Community

You can ask question in our #hacktoberfest source{d} Community slack channel - http://bit.ly/sourced-slack

Complete the form at https://go.sourced.tech/hacktoberfest  to make sure we take your participation into account. Weâ€™ll send you instructions for receiving your  limited edition source{d} t-shirt once Hacktoberfest is over.

## Code of Conduct

We'll be using the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).
